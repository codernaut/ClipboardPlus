# ClipBoard Plus Project Overview

![Promo](https://oormi.in/software/cbp/images/promohelp.jpg)


**ClipBoard Plus** is a free and open sourced windows application for viewing and managing a clipboard with multiple clips.

It maintains and can display up to five copied items or clips. Clips are arranged from newest to oldest.

Clicking on a clip loads it back into the clipboard and it is ready for pasting into another application. It also now becomes the lastest clip, and other clips scroll down.

To explore more features and functions of this utility, right click on it.

This tiny but useful utility is completely free and open sourced.
